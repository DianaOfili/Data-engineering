## About Me

I am a data engineer with a strong foundation in building scalable and efficient data systems. My expertise includes designing data architectures, creating data pipelines, automating ETL processes, and working with cloud platforms. I am passionate about optimizing data workflows to enable businesses to make data-driven decisions.

## Skills

- Data Pipeline Design and Development
- ETL Processes and Automation
- Data Warehousing (Redshift, Snowflake, BigQuery)
- Cloud Platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Database Management (SQL, NoSQL)
- Programming (Python, SQL, Bash)
- Big Data Technologies (Hadoop, Spark)
- Data Streaming (Kafka, Apache Flink)
- Docker & Kubernetes for Containerization
- CI/CD for Data Engineering

## Projects

### Project 1: Data Pipeline for E-commerce Analytics
Built an end-to-end data pipeline to aggregate and process transaction data from an e-commerce platform. The pipeline extracts raw data from various APIs, transforms it to clean and structure the data, and loads it into a data warehouse for analytics.

**Technologies Used**: Python, Airflow, PostgreSQL, AWS S3, Redshift, Pandas

### Project 2: Real-time Data Ingestion with Kafka
Developed a real-time data ingestion system using Apache Kafka to stream customer activity logs from various sources to a central data lake. Implemented stream processing with Apache Flink to generate real-time metrics and alerts.

**Technologies Used**: Kafka, Flink, Python, AWS Kinesis, Docker

### Project 3: Data Warehousing and ETL Automation
Automated ETL workflows to load large datasets into a cloud-based data warehouse (Snowflake). Designed data models for efficient querying and implemented data transformation processes using Python and SQL.

**Technologies Used**: Snowflake, Python, SQL, Apache Airflow, GitLab CI/CD

### Project 4: Cloud-Based Data Solutions with AWS
Created an end-to-end data solution on AWS, integrating services like S3, Lambda, and RDS for data storage, processing, and analytics. The project automates data ingestion and processing workflows to support business intelligence operations.

**Technologies Used**: AWS S3, Lambda, RDS, CloudFormation, Python

## Technologies

- **Data Pipelines**: Apache Airflow, Luigi, Prefect
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Snowflake, Redshift
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Azure, GCP
- **Big Data**: Hadoop, Apache Spark, Apache Kafka
- **Data Processing**: Apache Flink, Pandas, Dask
- **Containerization & Orchestration**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub, GitLab
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD
